            collect, use, disclose or process personal data for our purposes.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h6>PERSONAL DATA</h6>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <p>As used in this Notice: <br><br>
                <strong>"customer"</strong> means an individual who (a) has contacted us through any means to find out
                more

                or
                services by us; and <br><br>
                <strong>"personal data"</strong> means data, whether true or not, about a customer who can be
                identified:
                (a) from that data; or (b) from that data and other information to which we have or are likely to have
                access.
            </p>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <p>Depending on the nature of your interaction with us, some examples of personal data which we may collect
                from you include your name and identification information such as your NRIC number, contact information
                such

        <ol>
            <p>Other terms used in this Notice shall have the meanings given to them in the PDPA (where the context so
                permits).</p>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <h6>COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL DATA</h6>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <p>We generally do not collect your personal data unless (a) it is provided to us voluntarily by you
                directly or via a third party who has been duly authorised by you to disclose your personal data to us
                (your "authorised representative") after (i) you (or your authorised representative) have been notified
                of the purposes for which the data is collected, and (ii) you (or your authorised representative) have
                provided written consent to the collection and usage of your personal data for those purposes, or (b)
                collection and use of personal data without consent is permitted or required by the PDPA or other laws.
                We shall seek your consent before collecting any additional personal data and before using your personal
                data for a purpose which has not been notified to you (except where permitted or authorised by law).</p>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <p>We may collect and use your personal data for any or all of the following purposes:
                <br><br>
                (a) performing obligations in the course of or in connection with our provision of the goods and/or
                services requested by you;
                <br><br>
                (b) verifying your identity;
                <br><br>
                (c) responding to, handling, and processing queries, requests, applications, complaints,

        <br>
        <h6>WITHDRAWING YOUR CONSENT</h6>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <p>The consent that you provide for the collection, use and disclosure of your personal data will remain
                valid until such time it is being withdrawn by you in writing. You may withdraw consent and request us
                to stop using and/or disclosing your personal data for any or all of the purposes listed above by
                submitting your request in writing or via email to our Data Protection Officer at the contact details
                provided below.</p>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <p>Upon receipt of your written request to withdraw your consent, we may require reasonable time (depending
                on the complexity of the request and its impact on our relationship with you) for your request to be
                processed and for us to notify you of the consequences of us acceding to the same, including any legal
                consequences which may affect your rights and liabilities to us. In general, we shall seek to process
                your request within ten (10) business days of receiving it.
            </p>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <p>Whilst we respect your decision to withdraw your consent, please note that depending on the nature and
                scope of your request, we may not be in a position to continue providing our goods or services to you
                and we shall, in such circumstances, notify you before completing the processing of your request. Should
                you decide to cancel your withdrawal of consent, please inform us in writing in the manner described in
                clause 8 above.
            </p>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <p>Please note that withdrawing consent does not affect our right to continue to collect, use and disclose
                personal data where such collection, use and disclose without consent is permitted or required under
                applicable laws.
            </p>
        </ol>

        <h6>ACCESS TO AND CORRECTION OF PERSONAL DATA</h6>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <p>If you wish to make (a) an access request for access to a copy of the personal data which we hold about
                you or information about the ways in which we use or disclose your personal data, or (b) a correction
                request to correct or update any of your personal data which we hold about you, you may submit your
                request in writing or via email to our Data Protection Officer at the contact details provided below.

                fee before processing your request.</p>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <p>We will respond to your request as soon as reasonably possible. Should we not be able to respond to your
                request within thirty (30) days after receiving your request, we will inform you in writing within
                thirty (30) days of the time by which we will be able to respond to your request. If we are unable to
                provide you with any personal data or to make a correction requested by you, we shall generally inform
                you of the reasons why we are unable to do so (except where we are not required to do so under the
                PDPA).</p>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <h6>ACCESS TO AND CORRECTION OF PERSONAL DATA</h6>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <p>To safeguard your personal data from unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying,
                modification, disposal or similar risks, we have introduced appropriate administrative, physical and
                technical measures such as up-to-date antivirus protection, encryption and the use of privacy filters to
                secure all storage and transmission of personal data by us, and disclosing personal data both internally
                and to our authorised third party service providers and agents only on a need-to-know basis.
            </p>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <p>You should be aware, however, that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic
                storage is completely secure. While security cannot be guaranteed, we strive to protect the security of
                your information and are constantly reviewing and enhancing our information security measures.</p>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <h6>ACCURACY OF PERSONAL DATA</h6>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <p>We generally rely on personal data provided by you (or your authorised representative). In order to

                to your personal data by informing our Data Protection Officer in writing or via email at the contact
                details provided below.

        <h6>RETENTION OF PERSONAL DATA</h6>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <p>We may retain your personal data for as long as it is necessary to fulfil the purpose for which it was
                collected, or as required or permitted by applicable laws.
            </p>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <p>We will cease to retain your personal data, or remove the means by which the data can be associated with
                you, as soon as it is reasonable to assume that such retention no longer serves the purpose for which
                the personal data was collected, and is no longer necessary for legal or business purposes.</p>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <h6>TRANSFERS OF PERSONAL DATA OUTSIDE OF SINGAPORE</h6>
        <br>

                personal data continues to receive a standard of protection that is at least comparable to that provided
                under the PDPA.
